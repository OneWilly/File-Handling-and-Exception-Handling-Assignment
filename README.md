## Description

This assignment focuses on:
1. Efficiently managing files using Python's file handling techniques.
2. Handling unexpected issues gracefully using exception handling.

By the end of this project, you will have a solid understanding of how to:
- Read from and write to files.
- Handle errors such as missing files or inaccessible files.
- Create robust and user-friendly applications.

## Programs

### File Read & Write Challenge

This program reads the content of a file, processes it, and writes a modified version to a new file. Specifically:
- Reads the content of `input.txt`.
- Converts the content to uppercase.
- Writes the modified text and additional information (e.g., word count) to `output.txt`.

#### Key Features:
- Demonstrates file reading and writing.
- Modifies the content as part of the task.
- Ensures proper use of context managers for file operations.

### Error Handling Lab

This program asks the user for a filename and handles potential errors gracefully. It includes:
- Checking if the file exists.
- Handling errors if the file cannot be read.
- Displaying meaningful error messages to the user.

#### Key Features:
- Demonstrates exception handling in Python.
- Provides a user-friendly interface for error messages.
- Ensures robust and error-free execution.

## Outcomes

By completing this assignment, I have:
- Gained experience in managing files with Python.
- Understood how to handle common file-related errors.
- Learned to write clean, efficient, and user-friendly code.

## How to Run

### Prerequisites:
- Python 3.x installed on your system.

### Steps:
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OneWilly/File-Handling-and-Exception-Handling-Assignment.git
   cd File-Handling-and-Exception-Handling-Assignment
   ```

2. Run the `file_read_write.py` script:
   - Ensure you have an `input.txt` file in the same directory with some sample content.
   - Run the script:
     ```bash
     python3 file_read_write.py
     ```
   - Check the `output.txt` file for the modified content.

3. Run the `error_handling_lab.py` script:
   - Run the script:
     ```bash
     python3 error_handling_lab.py
     ```
   - Enter the name of a file when prompted. Test with existing and non-existing files to see how errors are handled.
